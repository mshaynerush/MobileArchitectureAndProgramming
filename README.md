Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
For people interested in tracking their weight for any reason, be it body building, losing weight, health, or just the desire to track things. The aim of this app will be to allow tracking of weight as desired, learn better nutrition and eventually provide social media sharing features to let you show people the new you.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
My designs will allow users to navigate the feautures they need and provide enough automation to keep them in the right place at the rigth time. They can enter current weights, enter new goal weights, edit or delete any entries and see their entries by date to monitor progress.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I focused on each module and activity as I went. I started with loggin in and registration so that users could keep track of their own progress. I then handled all of the initial data entry, such as initial and goal weights, After that I focused on displaying the results and allowing an edit/delete feature. Finally I fixed permissions to work with the user's choice, to keep the notifications at bay for those who deny messaging access, and made sure those that do will get notified when reaching milestones. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I tested each process as I completed it, then again, going through the app when it was completed tomake sure it bahaved as expected.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had the biggest challenge understanding how to take results of a query from a cursor and place them into a grid dynamicallhy. Once I figured out the Adapater, it was a bit easier, but it is still something I want more practice in.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think my SQL skills came in quite handy and really made a short job of getting, updating, editing and inserting data into databases. Understanding how that works really helped to give me time to focus on things I wasn't as certain of.
